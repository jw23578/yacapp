Yet Another Configurable App

## Object
To provide an easy Configurator to create own and custom Apps

## App and Configurator is One
The App and Configurator are the same Application.
Running the Application without any Parameter starts the Application in App-Mode
Running the Application with Parameter "Configurator" starts the Application in Configurator-Mode

## Idea
If you already have a Website, probably with a Login/Member-Area with this App you can create a downloadable and installable App for your customers an members
Typically you can use your Website in this App in Webviews and connect the Webview-Forms by a custom Menu.
On Sites which require a Login the App forces the User to login and remembers the Login. Therefore a Loginadapter needs to be provided.
